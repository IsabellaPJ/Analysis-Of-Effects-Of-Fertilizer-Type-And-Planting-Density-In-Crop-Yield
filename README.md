# Analysis-Of-Effects-Of-Fertilizer-Type-And-Planting-Density-In-Crop-Yield

## Problem Statement
Farmers are unable to pick most suitable fertilizer to be used for better crop yield.
So this paper aims at bringing an enhancement in the field of agriculture by achieving better results in crop yields.

## Objective
To analyze the effect of fertilizer type on crop yield.
To see which model is the best fit for the data to increase the crop yield.
To analyze the minimum support price.

## Dataset Used
Type of data: Numerical data
How data were acquired: From kaggle
Dataset name: crop_data
Data format: CSV file
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/yaliniraman/fertilizer-type-and-their-crop-yield
Dataset consist of 96 records.

## Crop Used:
Wheat

## Fertilizer Used:
1. Nitrogen
2. Potassium
3. Phosphorus

## Methods/Techniques/Tools Used
1. One Way ANOVA
2. Two Way ANOVA

## Output

## Inference
Feritilizer mix 3(Phosphorus) has high planting density.
So we prefer fertilizer mix 3 for better crop yield.
